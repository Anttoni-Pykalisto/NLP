# NLP Word2Vec Pipeline

The purpose of this repository is to be able to create a vocabulary of word vectors based on selected training data in the format of text files. This is done using a Word2Vec continuous skipgram model, where word vectors are trained based on comparing the each target with its context words (that are set up through its context window).
